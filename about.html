        <h2>About DarkConverse</h2>
        <!-- Add your about text here -->
        <p>Project DarkConverse is on-going project that was first started in 11/16. It was first strated by DarkerApple, an intermidiate coder, and now has a team of 5 people who moderates this sites and keeps it up to date. </p>
        <p>Our mission is to unleash people's creativity and make people post contents easily and talk with other users online. We do have goals on placing advertisement on the website in order to pay out bills, but that is a story for later. At the end of the day, this site was originally created to help users online post content without log-in.</p>
        <p>We believe that making communication easier will help everyone all around the globe and Hiding one's real name will give them less pressure on what they do and what they say. As a result, our site is 100% free, needs no login or username, and all actions are done in private. </p>
